                                <p class="blog-post-meta">Week 1, by <span class="font-gothic">My_Elliot</span>
                                </p>

                                <p>Even though sudden outbreak of the pandemics affects the regular life of people
                                    nationwide, I am still able to observe the annual and most important festival for
                                    Chinese. As the winter vacation started, I directly went back my home town in
                                    countryside instead of my house in another city because 14-days in-home quarantine
                                    was in need there but not in my home town. But each coin has two sides, that I had
                                    to monitor my health condition in the following 14 days and limit my activities in
                                    the public as much as possible. However, it’s still better than quarantine if
                                    considering the family dinner and party during the Chinese New Year, which is the
                                    most exhilarating and harmonious stuffs in the whole year and, luckily, I was
                                    allowed by the local government to attend the whole process of the activity during
                                    my health-monitoring period, in view of my constant “negative” in swab tests. </p>
                                <h2 id="1">1. Goods Purchase</h2>
                                <p>The first step is to prepare all the new year goods required by the tradition. These
                                    included fowls (e.g. chicken, ducks and gooses, which are for sacrifice to ancestors
                                    and, of course, for meal), snacks, stuffs for sacrifice ceremony (e.g. crackers,
                                    paper money, joss sticks and candles), fireworks, antithetical couplets, etc.
                                    Usually, my parents would prepare most of them in city and bring back home town
                                    before the CNY. However, since I was home in advance, I was allocated the mission to
                                    purchase some of the goods so that they won’t return with a load of stuffs.</p>
                                <p>The country fair was in more hustle and bustle than regular days because of the
                                    approaching festival. I shouldn’t have gone there because of the limitation, but
                                    nobody had a supervision on me and actually I was really free to go anywhere. The
                                    most exciting moment during this purchase was selecting and buying the fireworks! I
                                    admitted that the advantage of observing CNY in countryside is that you can light
                                    fireworks as many as you wish, which is unbelievable in city for the recent policies
                                    regarding air quality and safety issue that bans all the fireworks set off
                                    privately. Ridiculous, isn’t it? Is it merely in city that fireworks are dangerous
                                    and fire-prone? And is it really desperate for air quality to set off fireworks only
                                    for two days (new year eve and new year day)? I’m nostalgia and supportive to
                                    traditions, so I would rather light the fireworks and crackers that warm up the
                                    atmosphere than watch the boring Spring Festival Gala wasting my valuable vacation
                                    time. </p>

                                <h2 id="2">2. History Study</h2>
                                <p>Another precious moment is to put up an antithetical couplet and red papers with
                                    auspicious words at the new year eve. As usual, I assisted my dad on it, helping
                                    adjust the position of the couplet from a bystander perspective to prevent sticking
                                    it irregularly. At the same time, I listened to my father talking about the history
                                    of my family and clan. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a snap of the couplet this
                                    year which read:</p>
                                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                                    <p><em>金鉴千秋第，青钱万选家</em></p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>We all know that Chinese think highly of family and surname. Told by my dad, this
                                    couplet is peculiar to the Zhang (张, also spelled as “Chong” or “Cheung” by oversea
                                    ethnic Chinese) family among Chinese. The first line of the couplet, “金鉴千秋第”, tells
                                    the story of the most outstanding prime minister in Tang dynasty or even in the
                                    history of ancient China, namely, Zhang Jiuling（张九龄）. He concluded the experience of
                                    ruling a country by reviewing Chinese history and wrote an article titled The Book
                                    of Eternally Golden Counsel (《千秋金鉴录》) as a gift for the birthday of Emperor Xuanzong
                                    of Tang dynasty who is deemed as one of the most greatest emperors in Chinese
                                    history because he pushes the national power of China to a peak and all the
                                    neighboring countries pays tribute to Tang as respect. Among all the gifts which
                                    were mostly pearls and jewels, Zhang’s article didn’t arrest the attention of the
                                    emperor at the very beginning, instead, the emperor was slightly displeased for this
                                    ”cheap” gift. But as time went by, a court official, An Lushan, rebelled and the war
                                    to keep down the rebels greatly damage the national strength of Tang, triggering the
                                    declination of the dynasty. Actually, the rebellion could be prevented if the
                                    emperor fellow the counsel, and it was just from this war that the Emperor Xuanzong
                                    realized the value of the article Zhang wrote, being in deep remorse. </p>

                                <p>The second line of the couplet also describes the story of a talent Zhang in Tang
                                    dynasty. He was named Zhang Zhuo（张鷟）, who had took place imperial examination for
                                    eight times and past every one of them. His talent showed through these exams won
                                    him a title, “Copper coin the one-in-a-million（青钱万选）”, to honor his remarkable
                                    writing skill.</p>
                                <p>My family is full of atmosphere of traditions and culture, though both of my parents
                                    don’t receive adequate education. Actually, my dad learns the two stories above from
                                    the pedigree of our Zhang’s clan, and repeatedly tells to me every CNY not to mind
                                    taking troubles. Perhaps the western world don’t stress as much as we do on family
                                    and clan, but even if you don’t have oriental background, you can still feel the
                                    unity of these yellow-skin guys from their stories and behaviors. I’m proud of who I
                                    am after reading the Pedigree of Zhang’s Clan passed from my father’s father’s …
                                    father. And sometimes you can find something astonishing by reading it. Like me, I
                                    just cannot believe I’m the offspring of Zhang Jiuling, exactly speaking, the 46th
                                    generation. Perhaps that’s why we adapt his story to be the couplet of my house.

                                <h2 id="3">3. Family Party</h2>
                                <p>Just like Christmas Eve in the west, family in China get together to enjoy an annual
                                    dinner on the New Year Eve. And in the following days, especially the first day of
                                    the new year, all the family members sit down enjoying the valuable leisure moment
                                    at home. The elderly might prefer drinking tea and chatting on the family or social
                                    issues, while the middle-aged might set up a gambling by playing poker or mahjong.
                                    As for me, the health-monitoring and slightly introverted youngster, would like to
                                    kill my time through online chatting and video gaming with my friends and classmates
                                    hundreds of miles away. Each one got a recreation to do, and this was absolutely
                                    “home party”, I believed.</p>
                                <p>But things were a little bit different this year. I got more contemporaries with me
                                    and most of them were my cousins and nephews that didn’t celebrate the new year in
                                    hometown often. In this case, more topics of chatting could be raised and I was not
                                    that lonely at home. For the first time, a sense of harmony and delight arose even
                                    when I left off my phone and handle and sit on the sofa, listening to my siblings
                                    and cousins saying their attractive adventure across the world, with a cup of tea in
                                    my hand. The definitely delicious food Yaoji (The chicken pickled with sauce and
                                    spice and toasted in mud stove), the semi-finished milk beverage by my cousin and
                                    the herbal drink made by pickled dried tangerine peel would never be forgotten, and
