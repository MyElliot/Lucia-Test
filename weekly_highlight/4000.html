                                <p>Who ignites my desire to keep the memorable moment weekly? I’d like to mention
                                    one of the most popular and amiable professors I’ve ever met, namely, prof. Thilo
                                    Hagen at National University of Singapore (NUS). He, like many other prof., <a
                                        href="https://thilohagen.com/">owns a
                                        website/blog</a> to present any relative information on his lab and his CV, in
                                    order to
                                    showcase the achievement he gets and catch the eyes off of any potential applicants.
                                    But what’s more to this, he’s also willing to share some info unrelated to science
                                    and more on personality and daily life in that site, for instance, his <a
                                        href="https://thilohagen.com/weekly-highlights-2022-first-half/">weekly
                                        highlight</a>, which is uncommon among the folk of professors. That impresses me
                                    a lot.
                                    I just cannot imagine how a university professor could squeeze his time attending so
                                    many activities and constantly keep recording them, as described in his blog. In my
                                    stereotype, a prof. or a researcher has no more time over leisure activity until I
                                    meet Thilo who does really well on teaching (LSM2233 Cell Biology) and science
                                    research at the same time.</p>
                                <p>“Am I also able to have the possession of both scientific works and entertainment in
                                    my future career?” I confuse. But every time I come across problems on “do or
                                    don’t”, if no apparent pitfalls are there, my creed is to go ahead and see what it
                                    could be. Obviously, learning new techniques that establish a personal website could
                                    only enhance my ability and make me more competitive in my future career, and in
                                    exchange, I merely need to pay for time that are relatively adequate especially
                                    during my vacation. Hence, I go the whole hog running a website including not only
                                    weekly journals and CV, but also some points of view which I don’t want to put
                                    forward on other platforms or social media for some reasons.</p>
                                <p>Perhaps one another motivation is to enhance my English writing, in preparation for
                                    the possible standardized English examination like IELTS and TOEFL. I should have
                                    finished either one of them in my first or second year, but unfortunately, I didn’t
                                    realize the significance of it so now I basically lose the opportunity to further my
                                    graduate study in oversea universities or institutes. However, my thirst on an
                                    oversea research experience is never quenched. A postdoctoral job can also cheer me
                                    up. And don’t forget that I’m a biology student after all, who is destined to deal
                                    with piles of research papers written in English.</p>
                                <p>Whatever the trigger is, my action on constructing a personal blog <I>de novo</i> has been
                                    ignited. Amigos, we’ll see what happens.</p>
