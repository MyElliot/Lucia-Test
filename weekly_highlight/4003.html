                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now it is 20min after the end of my eighth examination in a single week and I rush
                                    to the library for a desk available for me to type in this very Weekly Highlight
                                    that has been over two weeks apart.
                                </p>
                                <p>As I mentioned in the past few weeks, the final exams of the last semester were
                                    postponed to the beginning of this sem. Actually, it’s not an exciting news for most
                                    of us students, because we have spent at least one week on systematic review on the
                                    coursework, hence, the postpone just make those time meaningless. And the coming
                                    winter vacation is also ruined in view of the stress and anxiety on the undone
                                    exams. </p>
                                <p>I have much more exams to take (nine courses) compared with my classmates (four or
                                    five courses in average), which is the sequel of my most adventurous
                                    experience—being a visiting student in NUS for one semester. To be more detailed, I
                                    submitted an application to delay my final exams in my second year to my third year
                                    because I had to fly to Singapore for the visiting program during the exam week,
                                    which was ultimately approved. Therefore, I got twice the number of exams when I
                                    returned and should finish them in the exam weeks that lasted two weeks.</p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>What’s worse to me, the dean’s office of my university (we have no idea what they
                                    truly care) decided to compress the time scale for exams, namely, from two weeks to
                                    one weeks plus one weekend. That really made me exhausted because they were
                                    ridiculously “one hundred percent confident on me” and organized seven exams in four
                                    days for this poor year 3 student, from Probability to Maoism and from University
                                    Physics to Molecular Immunity. To cope with the X-game-like timetable, I forced
                                    myself to cut off the last 11 days of the winter vacation to go over the books that
                                    has already been unfamiliar for me. I had to say I was really anxious and nervous at
                                    that time because the outside of my room is the green spring with flowers and songs
                                    but the inside is in contrast crowed with complicated formulars, symbols, essays and
                                    draft papers covered with a mass of figures.</p>
                                <p>To be honest, my competitive mood and the afraid of being a failure on exams drive me
                                    up a wall in those days. And the consequence is my worsened health conditions. Let’s
                                    say the sudden break of acne and pimples on my face and the difficulty to fall
                                    asleep. Luckily, the nightmare is almost over now, and I’ve finished eight exams in
                                    the first week of examination. Whereas the last will approach to me next Sunday
                                    evening, that is to say 7 days later, I will not be so exhausted any more. Besides
                                    the sense of run-down, I am more concerning about the scores, which are crucial to
                                    my application for graduate study in a top university or institute. The exams I’ve
                                    taken are not easy to me, I admit, thus the anxiety of getting a quite bad GPA
                                    stucks my mind at the moment. However, I am already too frustrated and tired to make
                                    any complaints on the exam plan and the potential result. Besides I never heard some
                                    of my friends, who also have five or six exams crowding in these few days, complain
                                    desperately and endlessly. Hence, I bring myself a soul soother that says:</p>
                                <blockquote class="blockquote fst-italic">“At least you make it and just let alone the
                                    scores, Weiping. Perhaps you
                                    are the only one in the history of XJTU to take 7 exams in 4 days and 9 exams in
                                    total. Proud of you”</blockquote>
                                <p>From now on I am able to free myself from the desks and chairs and care about other
                                    stuffs. My websites, my applications for graduate studies, my science and lab work,
                                    my beloved rice noodle, all my dear friends in this universe... Yes, they are the
                                    pearls and jewels the world fetches, and now my job is to admire the beauty of them
                                    and wait for the announcing day for the exam results. We will see what happens. </p>
