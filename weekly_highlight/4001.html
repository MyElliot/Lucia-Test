                                        background introduction. Briefly speaking, I went home for vacation after an
                                        uneasy month of
                                        lockdown and the Spring Festival is approaching.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Last month, my city, Xi’an, was undergoing one of the most serious COVID-19
                                    pandemics in
                                    China after the original one that took place in Wuhan. Dozens of positives were
                                    detected
                                    every day. Although the figure is not that exaggerated compared with that in France,
                                    Italy or the USA, it still greatly led to panic and turbulence in community. Just
                                    because of this, the city was totally locked down and all the public or private
                                    activities were forbidden, hoping to cut off the spread of virus.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the very beginning of lockdown, we could still walk around freely without
                                    restriction, as long as not going outside the campus. But a few days later, an
                                    updated
                                    policy required that all the students in university should stay indoors. That’s
                                    killing
                                    to me because our final exams were not finished yet, and locking indoors means I had
                                    to
                                    go over my course in a narrow and noisy room, namely, my dormitory shared with three
                                    other roommates. The efficiency of study would be greatly affected, undoubtedly.
                                </p>
                                <figure class="figure">

                                        class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">We were not allowed to hang out freely, and every
                                        dormitory could only go out 3 person-time per day</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    In this special month, other than reviewing day in day out, swab tests were the most
                                    common events we had to take part. That made me feel sick because it was not
                                    surprising that
                                    you
                                    spent over one hour on queueing with the atmosphere temperature of around 5℃, and
                                    this
                                    torment take place every two days. But thank god the administration department of
                                    our
                                    university solved the problem by arranging the time slot properly so that every
                                    student
                                    merely had to fit the recommended time and did the swab test as scheduled.
                                </p>

                                <p>One month later, the pandemics was under controlled and the city could be unlocked
                                    gradually. On Jan. 19, 2022, my university announced the winter vacation this year,
                                    which
                                    would start in two days and last one month, but the specific returning time remains
                                    unknown due to the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemics. This announcement was
                                    based on the fact that the region my university locates in had no more positive case
                                    and
                                    had turned to “low-risk” during the lockdown, otherwise no one should be permitted
                                    to
                                    leave the region. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Regaining freedom and vacation should be exciting, however, I was not sure whether I
                                    could go back home or not, because the entry policy of each city in China changes
                                    every
                                    day owing to the unpredictability of the pandemics as well. Sometimes I could go
                                    back
                                    home without 14-day quarantine but just one day later I couldn’t. I didn’t want to
                                    be
                                    locked
                                    at home again, thus in this case you would never successfully persuade me going
                                    home,
                                    regardless of the approaching Spring Festival. And just because of the wavering of
                                    entry
                                    policy, I booked and returned the ticket for twice, and lost an amount of money as
                                    service fees.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But ultimately, I was on my way home on Jan. 25, 2022 because of the better
                                    situation.
                                    At that day, crowded passengers formed jams in Xi’an North railway station, like a
                                    blanket made by people and their heads are just like woolen ball protruding on polar
                                    fleece. It’s amazing that Chinese are sooooooo keen on rushing back home to observe
                                    the
                                    Spring Festival. Perhaps that is the homesickness and nostalgia.

                                        to go home for the annual Spring Festival. In China, we describe such crowd as

                                    Above I wrote a laundry list of stuffs happened in the past one month, actually not
                                    a weekly
                                    highlight.
                                    I do this because here is the first article of “Weekly Highlight” and it is
                                    important to
                                    start with a background introduction. And here the background is, briefly, that the
                                    Spring Festival is
                                    approaching so I
                                    went
                                    home for winter break after an uneasy month of lockdown. Next
                                    week
                                    could be kind of interesting, I hope.
